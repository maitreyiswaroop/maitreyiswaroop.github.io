<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

About me. -->
======
Hi! I'm Maitreyi, a final-year BSc. + MSc. student at [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) majoring in Mathematics & Computing. Along with my academic studies I am currently interning at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) at [Prof. Dhanya Sridhar](https://www.dsridhar.com/)'s Causal ML Research Group. 
In Summer 2022 I interned at [Dr. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/)'s Human-Centric Machine Learning Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/).

I am fascinated by algorithms and their applications in life sciences and social sciences. My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning, and more specifically in probabilistic models, causal inference, representation learning and graph machine learning.

I also enjoy running (having run track in high school and college), reading and playing the piano. I am an avid quizzer and an active part of the IIT Kharagpur Quiz Club. You can find some of my sets [here](https://maitreyiswaroop.github.io/misc/). I also like to dabble in translating texts and making stop motion animations.
