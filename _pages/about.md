<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

About me. -->
<!-- ====== -->
Hi! I'm Maitreyi, a first-year PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by [Prof. Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/). 

Previously, I was at [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), where I majored in Mathematics & Computing, and was fortunate to work with [Prof. Partha Pratim Chakrabarti](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~ppchak/) for my master's thesis. 

Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with [Amit Sharma](https://amitsharma.in/) and [Vineeth Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/) at Microsoft Research (Summer 2025), with [Prof. Dhanya Sridhar](https://www.dsridhar.com/)'s Causal ML Research Group at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) (Summer 2023-24), and earlier with [Dr. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/)'s Human-Centric Machine Learning Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/).

My research interests span causal machine learning, developing methods robust to distribution shifts, and small model optimization techniques. Always happy to chat about these - especially if you're into theory-meets-practice conversations.

I also enjoy running (having run track in high school and college), playing squash, reading and playing the piano. I am an avid quizzer was the governor of the IIT Kharagpur Quiz Club. You can find some of my sets [here](https://sites.google.com/view/maitreyiswaroop/quizzing). I also like to dabble in making stop motion animations - which you might come across on some pages!
