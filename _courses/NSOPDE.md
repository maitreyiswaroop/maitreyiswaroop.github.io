A [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vuS-mCkyEX9JqrXa2EvfscBvHjGL5MAT?usp=sharing) to keep a repository of the topics I've learned in the Numerical Solutions of Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations course (**MA20102**, IIT Kharagpur) taught in the 4th semester. I have also plotted some solved examples for a better visual understanding of the solutions. The examples are taken from various sources- lectures, the course textbook-*Numerical Methods for Scientific and Engineering Computation by R.K. Jain and S.R.K. Iyengar (7th ed.)* etc.
The code here was written by me after referring to the formulae in the textbook, if you have any questions/suggestions/comments, feel free to ask me.
