My [notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16t-50fjAofGXvj20Ew6pGmE2K8hofkP6/view?usp=sharing) for one of my favourite undergrad courses, Modern Algebra (**MA30002**, IIT Kharagpur) taught in the 6th semester. The notes are written in LaTeX. There may be errors in this file, though I hope not too many. If you find any, feel free to reach out to me by email.
